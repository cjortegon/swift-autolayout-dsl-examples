# Swift Auto-layout DSL examples

This project has been written using 4 of the most known DSL to Auto-layout in code to see the differences between them. The libraries are:
* [SnapKit/SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit) (5.0.0)
* [robb/Cartography](https://github.com/robb/Cartography) (3.0)
* [PureLayout/PureLayout](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout) (3.1.4)
* [Mortar/Core_NoCreatable](Mortar/Core_NoCreatable) (1.6)

The project contains 4 different ViewControllers with the same design using the each of the libraries. The UIKit components can be found [here](https://github.com/cjortegon/swift-autolayout-dsl-examples/blob/master/AutolayoutDSLTest/Gist/BaseGist.swift). And the layouts for each application are this:
* Example using [SnapKit](https://github.com/cjortegon/swift-autolayout-dsl-examples/blob/master/AutolayoutDSLTest/Gist/SnapkitGist.swift)
* Example using [Cartography](https://github.com/cjortegon/swift-autolayout-dsl-examples/blob/master/AutolayoutDSLTest/Gist/CartographyGist.swift)
* Example using [PureLayout](https://github.com/cjortegon/swift-autolayout-dsl-examples/blob/master/AutolayoutDSLTest/Gist/PurelayoutGist.swift)
* Example using [Mortar](https://github.com/cjortegon/swift-autolayout-dsl-examples/blob/master/AutolayoutDSLTest/Gist/MortarGist.swift)
